# RangeTree
Java Implementation of 2D Range Tree based on this slide.

This is not the most efficient one but can be extended to higher dimensions easily.

PS: The code is not clean, thanks to the proper time of the deadline. (yes, this is the final project of Data Structures course)

PS: The construction of y-tree is [lazy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation). (the original RangeTree is not like this. I did it as a trick to pass all of the test cases =)) )
